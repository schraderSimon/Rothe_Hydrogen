# Rothe's method for the Hydrogen method
This repo contains all of the code required to reproduce the results from our paper [https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0213576]( https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0213576).

This repo contains the code for the Rothe method applied to the Hydrogen atom as well as the necessary files to produce the figures, including the reference files. 
In order to obtain the data from the Rothe propagations, the file in the "Rothe/data/NEWNEW" directory has to be extracted.
